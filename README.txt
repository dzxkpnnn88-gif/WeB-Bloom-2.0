# Web Bloom — Ready-to-deploy Site

This package contains a simple, modern, mobile-friendly website for Web Bloom.

## Included files
- index.html
- about.html
- services.html
- portfolio.html
- contact.html
- assets/style.css
- assets/script.js

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repository named `webbloom` (or any name).
2. Upload all files and the `assets/` folder to the repository root.
3. In the repository, go to Settings → Pages → Branch: choose `main` and folder `/ (root)` → Save.
4. Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`.

## Contact form
This template uses Formspree (https://formspree.io) for contact form submissions. Replace the `action` attribute in `contact.html` with your Formspree form endpoint (or your own backend).

## Customize
- Replace images in `portfolio.html` with your screenshots.
- Update copy and prices in `services.html`.
- Update email address in `contact.html`.

Good luck — if you want me to
- generate screenshots for the portfolio
- create a favicon
- create a proper logo
I can do that next.
